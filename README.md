# Coin-Flip-Game

Language: Java

Description: This game is being developed by me in my free time. A user places a bet and guesses if the coin will flip heads or tails. The coin is then flipped and if the user guessses correctly, the money they bet will be doubled and put back into their account to bet again.

Goals:
- Implement a GUI.
- Add a high score system that will save user's highest account and will reappear the next time they use the application.
